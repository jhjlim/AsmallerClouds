Schematic/board files for an 8HP version of Clouds

This Eagle project uses the original mutable instruments design files. It simply repositions all components to fit in an 8HP module.
I did this layout as a side project because I love the clouds module and wanted more in my system without sacrificing other space! The only component changes are the crystals to a smaller package, 3mm red/green LEDs and a different illuminated push button. The RESET(SW5) and SYSBOOT(SW4) tactile switches were also dropped and replaced with accesible pads that can be shorted.
